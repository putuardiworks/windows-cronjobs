## Motivation

When developing a PHP project that requires cron jobs, I usually test them directly in cPanel. This process feels somewhat cumbersome and inefficient for local development, especially if you don't have cPanel hosting. Additionally, it can be difficult to know which scripts have been set as cron jobs and what their configurations are in cPanel.

Windows Cronjobs was developed to address these issues. By providing functionality similar to cPanel cron jobs, this tool allows us to test cron jobs locally on Windows and ensure that cron jobs configurations are well-documented within the code.

## Setup

1. **Download and Extract:**
   - Download the repository as a `.zip` file.
   - Extract the contents.

2. **Copy Configuration File:**
   - Make a copy of `windows-cronjobs.config.example`.
   - Rename the copied file to `windows-cronjobs.config`.

3. **Configuration:**
   - Open `windows-cronjobs.config`.
   - Set `php_path` to the location of your `php.exe`. (required)
   - Set the `timezone`. (optional)

4. **Add Cron Jobs:**
   - Edit `cronjobs_list.php`.
   - Add your cron jobs as shown in the example.

## Usage

  - Double-click `windows-cronjobs.bat` to start the cron jobs.

- **Stop Cron Jobs:**
  - Press `Ctrl+C` in the PowerShell window that was opened when starting the cron jobs.
